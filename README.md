As a kid, it was always difficult for me to understand various varieties of trees. It's still the case today for some species of tree in my area.
It's pretty cool to see atleast machine learning help in remembering the various varieties of trees.

I am planning to deploy this based on two ways:

- [x] Voila
- [ ] Vue + FastAPI combination
